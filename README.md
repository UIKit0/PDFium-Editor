# PDFium-Editor
Stripped down pdfium (no v8) plus a fork of PDFium-Viewer for editing PDFs

Taken from pdfium-viewer then stripped down the pdfium part and added some work on the stuff for text extraction and page editing.
Then added those funtions into the c# wrapper along with some other more editing focused stuff. 
Ignoring things not relevant to printed documents. (js/forms/actions etc)
